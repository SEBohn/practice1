<h1> <div class=quatro>Welcome to my blog about computer science and my life!</div></h1>
<p>Computer science has always been a big part of my life, at least starting in school when I was introduced to computers.<br>
Now I'm learning all sorts of things about coding, security, and hardware! It's a lot of fun to learn though can sometimes get confusing.</p>
